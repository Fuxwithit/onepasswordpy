`onepasswordpy` is a pure-python library for manipulating
[1Password](https://agilebits.com/onepassword) keychain files. Right now, it
supports decrypting and loading all data types. Creation of new items will
come in a future release.

*IMPORTANT NOTE*: I am not in any way affiliated with AgileBits, the makers
of 1Password. Their software is awesome and you should probably go buy it.
Please don't sue me!

Dependencies
------------
This project depends on the following upstream libraries:

* simplejson
* pycrypto
* pbkdf2

This is a human-readable denormalized list; for the actual list, look at `setup.py`.

It also probably only runs on Python 2.6 and 2.7.
